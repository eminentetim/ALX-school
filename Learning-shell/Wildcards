Before we begin using our commands, we need to talk about the shell fea-
ture that makes these commands so powerful. Because the shell uses file-
names so much, it provides special characters to help you rapidly specify
groups of filenames. These special characters are called wildcards. Using
wildcards (also known as globbing) allows you to select filenames based on
patterns of characters. Table 4-1 lists the wildcards and what they select.
