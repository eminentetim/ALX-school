ls
file
less

-a--allList all files, even those with names that begin
with a period, which are normally not listed
(i.e., hidden).
-d--directoryOrdinarily, if a directory is specified, ls
will list the contents of the directory, not the
directory itself. Use this option in conjunction
with the -l option to see details about the
directory rather than its contents.
-F--classifyThis option will append an indicator character
to the end of each listed name (for example, a
forward slash if the name is a directory).
-h--human-readableIn long format listings, display file sizes in
human-readable format rather than in bytes.
Display results in long format.
-l
-r
--reverse
Display the results in reverse order. Normally,
ls displays its results in ascending alpha-
betical order.
-SSort results by file size.
-tSort by modification time.
